# Wine Identification

## Description
Created as an Applied Deep Learning Trainee as part of the MIT FutureMakers program, a collaboration between the MIT RAISE initiative and SureStart. More information on my work during the program can be found here: [https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers](https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers)

This is part of the [Keras](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/deep-learning-python) tutorial. Trained new model that increased accuracy to over 99.5%

## Dataset
The dataset can be found here: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/). I downloaded `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv`.
